## Brief 
* Choose to work solo or in a team
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers.
* **Be deployed online** so it’s publicly accessible.
